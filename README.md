## üî¨ Scientific Background

### Protein Data Bank (PDB) Files
- Standard format for 3D structural data of biological macromolecules
- Contains atomic coordinates, sequence information, and structural data

### Alpha Carbon (CŒ±) Atoms
- Backbone atoms that define protein fold and structure
- Each amino acid has one CŒ± atom
- Using only CŒ± atoms provides 20x faster computation while preserving 95% of structural information

### Kabsch Algorithm
- Mathematical method for optimal structural alignment
- Finds best rotation and translation to superimpose two structures
- Uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for optimal rotation matrix

### RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation)
- Primary metric for structural similarity
- Lower RMSD = higher structural similarity
- Standard interpretation:
  - RMSD < 2.0 √Ö: High structural similarity ‚úì
  - RMSD 2.0-4.0 √Ö: Moderate structural similarity ‚óã
  - RMSD > 4.0 √Ö: Low structural similarity ‚úó
